  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Hello and welcome! My name is <strong>Thabiswa Khumalo</strong>, and I’m the proud founder of <strong>Thabiswa Fashion</strong>, a brand born from passion, creativity, and a deep love for self-expression through style. I’m more than just a fashion lover — I’m also a hard-working entrepreneur with experience in customer service, digital platforms, and small business consulting. I enjoy building strong relationships with clients and helping them feel confident and stylish in what they wear. Every outfit I showcase is not just a garment — it tells a story, reflects a mood, and boosts confidence. Fashion is not just what I do — it’s who I am. Whether I’m styling an outfit, presenting a new clothing collection, or working behind the scenes to manage and grow my brand, I bring my heart, soul, and energy into everything. I believe fashion should be <em>inclusive, expressive, and empowering</em>. I love mixing trends with timeless pieces, bold colours with clean cuts, and comfort with elegance.</p>

  <p>Through <strong>Thabiswa Fashion</strong>, I aim to inspire others to dress boldly, confidently, and unapologetically — no matter who they are.</p>
